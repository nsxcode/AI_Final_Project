Abstract: This project was about learning how to use Pycaret. For this project I performed regression on  the White Wine dataset with the target being ‘alcohol’. The model that was chosen for this project is Light Gradient Boosting Machine as it was the best model when comparing the models. The performance on the predicted data is 0.90.
